How to Run the Program.
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
Run the program using the command: 
    - python todo_list_manager.py or python3 todo_list_manager.py.

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with your todo list!
Consider Additional Enhancements.
If you want to expand on this, consider adding features such as:
1. Saving the todo list to a file so that it persists between sessions.
2. Adding due dates for tasks.
3. Implementing sorting or filtering of tasks based on their completion status.
4. Allowing the user to update existing tasks.
This project will help you practice using functions, lists, dictionaries,
and user input in Python, and you can customize it further based on your
preferences!
